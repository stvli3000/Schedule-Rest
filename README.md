# Schedule-Rest

Do you often forget to stop hard working, playing games, watching movies when time flies quietly? If yes, good on you, this is not necessary for you. If NOOOOOOO, I hope this little 33KB green application may help sometimes. This Schedule Rest application helps schedule shutdown / hibernate / sleep computer on time, comes with System tray icon. This is my first Windows application, tends to be green and pure, no installation, ADs or network communication asked. This application provides following features:

  - System Tray Icon 

  - Supports English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and possibly Vietnamese 

  - Default is Pure Green, no installation or extra file writing to hard disk

  - New Save Settings function 
  
        - Check it and Start the timer, creates a tiny plain text file parallel to the executable file. 
    
        - Next time start the application will continue the current time setting. 
    
        - Uncheck it, the next time start this application, will load the current time to the setting box.

  - Start on boot function, check / uncheck this function, a shortcut will be, added to / removed from, the Windows System Startup. No Windows System Registy changing or rubish file will be made.
  
  - Less than one minute alert message popup 

Tested on Windows 10 PC and Windows 7. However, some version of Windows 10 on pad does not support both Suspend and Hibernate mode, hereby only Shutdown mode supported on pad version of Windows 10.

The application utilises .Net. It's name convention will follow: 

  - ScheduledRest_RevX.X_Win7_.Net3.5 : for .Net3.5 framework, default Windows 7 and Windows2008R2 support.

  - ScheduledRest_RevX.X_Win10_.Net4.6 : for .Net4.6 framework, default Windows 10 support.

  - ScheduledRest_RevX.X_WinVista_.Net2.0 : for .Net2.0 framework, default Windows Vista supports.

If you have any good idea, please let me know. I am happy to make it better for you and everyone.
